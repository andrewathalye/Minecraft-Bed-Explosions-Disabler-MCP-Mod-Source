# Minecraft Bed Explosions Disabler (MCP Mod)
This helpful MCP mod will allow you to disable bed explosions when sleeping, for example, in the nether. It will work for versions 1.10.2 onward, just create an issue if there is a version that you need supported.

#Installation for Advanced MCP-ers
For those with knowledge of MCP and/or bspatch, just download mcp with standard mappings and bspatch the files required for your version. This is a SOURCE patch, not a BINARY patch, so it is still open source whilst not disobeying Mojang's EULA!
