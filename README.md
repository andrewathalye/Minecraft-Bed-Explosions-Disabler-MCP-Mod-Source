# Minecraft Bed Explosions Disabler (MCP Mod)
This helpful MCP mod will allow you to disable bed explosions when sleeping, for example, in the nether. It will work for versions 1.10.2 onward, just create an issue if there is a version that you need supported.

# Installation for Advanced MCP-ers
For those with knowledge of MCP and/or bspatch, just download mcp with standard mappings and bspatch the files required for your version. This is a SOURCE patch, not a BINARY patch, so it is still open source whilst not disobeying Mojang's EULA!

# Installation for Intermediate MCP-ers
Coming soon!

# Installation for Noob MCP-ers

Download Minecraft Server 1.10.
Rename the jar file minecraft_server.jar
Move it to its own folder
Install the Java 8 JDK
Install bsdiff and bspatch
Save the text from https://pastebin.com/Kn5EkYmC to a file called mod.bat
Download the required bin_1.10 patches.
Put these in the same folder as your minecraft_server.jar
Run mod.bat
Enjoy!
